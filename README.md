# Description

The VSTS Extension tasks help you to Package, Publish and Share your Extensions for Visual Studio Online and Team Foudnation Server 2015 update 2 using Build and Release Management.

Additional features include:

 * Overriding the Extension version in your extension manifest. (You can use the Build Number for example!);
 * Retrieve the latest published version from the marketplace;
 * Installing, Publishing, Sharing your extension from a Build or a Release Management workflow;
 * Overriding the Build Task version in your task manifest;
 * Overriding the visibility of the extension on the marketplace (Private, Public);
 * Building different versions for your own internal development, private testing and public consumption on the marketplace.

These tasks depend on the Cross Platform Commandline Tools and they can optionally pull down these tools automatically when they're not available.

Check out the project wiki for a [walkthrough explaining the setup of your build definition](https://github.com/jessehouwing/vsts-extension-tasks/wiki/How-to-Setup-build).
