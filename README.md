The VSTS Extension tasks help you to Package, Publish and Share your Extensions for Visual Studio Online and Team Foudnation Server 2015 update 2
using Build and Release Management.

Additional features include:

 * Overriding the Extension version in your extension manifest. (You can use the Build Number for example!);
 * Overriding the Build Task version in your task manifest;
 * Overriding the visibility of the extension on the marketplace (Private, Public);
 * Building different versions for your own internal development, private testing and public consumption on the marketplace.

These tasks depend on the Cross Platform Commandline Tools and they can optionally pull down these tools automatically when they're not available.

# Preview Notice

These tasks are currently in preview. In order to actually publish anything on the marketplace you need to open the Advanced section and uncheck the Preview option.
